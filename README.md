### Overview
This repository contains the conceptual foundation of the *Coherence Triad* — a research series exploring how information-theoretic separation can preserve meaning, safety, and coherence across human and machine systems.

The paper **"Affective Coherence: An Information-Theoretic Approach to Context in Personalized Media"** introduces the core idea of *orthogonal propagation* as a safeguard against affective contamination — the blending of incompatible emotional or perceptual states in personalized systems.

### The Coherence Triad
1. **Affective Coherence** — Cognitive & philosophical foundation (this repo)  
2. **Information-Theoretic Orchestration in Federated Graphs (IT-OFNG)** — Mathematical framework  
3. **Cislunar EMORC** — Applied implementation for distributed command & control  

Together, they describe a single lineage of theory → model → application, uniting affective computing, information geometry, and autonomous systems design.
