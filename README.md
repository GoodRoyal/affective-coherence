### 1. Orientation

*Affective Coherence* is the **root document** of the *Coherence Framework* — a long-term exploration of how human emotional structure, information theory, and federated machine systems converge around a single principle:  
**meaning survives only through separation.**

This repository is where the idea begins — in the human domain — before it formalizes into the mathematical kernel (IT-OFNG) and operationalizes into specific systems (EMORC and beyond).

You can imagine the triad as three developmental stages of the same intelligence:

| Layer | Function | Example |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Affective (Child)** | Learns boundaries through emotion; coherence through feeling | “Warmth must not leak into horror.” |
| **Mathematical (Kernel)** | Encodes boundaries in information geometry | Perp-KL, Orthogonal Propagation, Scale-Entropy Modulation |
| **Operational (Adult)** | Executes boundaries in federated, autonomous systems | EMORC in Cislunar Command & Control |

### 2. The Kernel and Its Facings

The mathematical kernel described in **IT-OFNG** has two “faces”:

- **Software-facing (logic):** algorithms for orthogonal propagation and temporal modulation — how clean context windows are computed, scheduled, and maintained.  
- **Hardware-facing (mechanism):** the substrate that makes those computations real — sensor fusion, dynamic memory allocation, bandwidth regulation, quantum or neuromorphic architectures.  

Together they allow **dynamic clean context windows at scale** — the ability for *n* autonomous agents to act on federated impulses without contaminating one another’s state. Each agent maintains a sovereign subspace, negotiates influence, and modulates timing through entropy weighting.  

In affective terms: each child learns to play in the same room without losing its own imagination.

### 3. Structure of the Framework

The *Coherence Framework* grows outward from this root:

affective-coherence/ ← Philosophical & psychological foundation
information-theoretic-federated-graphs/ ← Mathematical kernel (IT-OFNG)
cislunar-emorc/ ← First operational instantiation (C2 resilience)
applications/
├── education-contexts/ ← (future) personalized learning coherence
├── therapeutic-systems/ ← (future) affective safety in adaptive therapy
├── pluralism-engine/ ← (future) belief sovereignty & ethical federation
└── others…


Each new application repository should:
1. Reference this root as its conceptual origin.  
2. Use the mathematical kernel as the mechanism.  
3. Add a README section explaining how orthogonal propagation and temporal modulation apply to its specific domain.

### 4. Research Ethos

This project assumes that the child, the mathematician, and the soldier are the same intelligence viewed through different time windows.

It is not a metaphor for empathy; it is an architecture for survival — of identity, of mission, of meaning.

To protect coherence at scale, the framework must remain open: each new domain can federate with the others through well-defined interfaces without contamination. That’s the scientific and ethical core.

### 5. Roadmap

- **2025.Q4:** publish and timestamp *Affective Coherence* (conceptual root)  
- **2026.Q1:** finalize IT-OFNG (mathematical kernel)  
- **2026.Q2:** conduct EMORC validation (C2 application)  
- **Ongoing:** integrate additional domains under `/applications/`
